"Actually, I don't know, what you're doing."
"My name is Revoca. I can help you learn new languages.\nIf you don't have a vocabulary you need to create one using /new_vocabulary comand. New vocabulary will automatically become active, but if you want to switch back, use /switch_vocabulary.\nEmpty vocabularies are boring: to add a new word type /add_word.\nIf you don't know a translation, it's best to type /translate_word and then save it to your vocabulary.\nTo train your vocabulary type /game and choose a game you want to play.\nTo list the words from your vocabulary type /list_words.\nTo delete a vocabulary use /delete_vocabulary.\nTo change notification settings type /change_notification_settings and follow instructions.\nAlso you can change my main language, just type /change_language.\nHope you'll enjoy working with me. But let's keep it professional."
