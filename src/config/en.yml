    idle: "My name is Revoca. I can help you learn new languages.\n
    If you don't have a vocabulary you need to create one using /new_vocabulary comand. New vocabulary will automatically become active, but if you want to switch back, use /switch_vocabulary.\n
    Empty vocabularies are boring: to add a new word type /add_word.\n
    If you don't know a translation, it's best to type /translate_word and then save it to your vocabulary.
    To train your vocabulary type /random_word to get a random word in learning language or /random_translation to get a translation. Then you'll be asked to translate it.\n
    To list the words from your vocabulary type /list_words.\n
    To delete a vocabulary use /delete_vocabulary.\n
    To change notification settings type /change_notification_settings and follow instructions.\n
    Also you can change my main language, just type /change_language.
    Hope you'll enjoy working with me. But let's keep it professional."
